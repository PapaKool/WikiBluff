# WikiBluff
A Wikipedia bluffing game built using a Python host/JS browser client.

Communication is done (unencrypted) over websockets.

This game is still a work in progress. There will likely be many bugs, some things may crash, etc etc.

Feel free to modify this game however you see fit. I am not the best programmer in the world, and I'm sure this idea could be done better.
